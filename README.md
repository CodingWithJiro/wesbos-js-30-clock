This project adapts a [granular branching and commit workflow](https://github.com/CodingWithJiro/wesbos-js-30-clock/network) to simulate team collaboration. Each feature, fix, documentation, and chore is tracked in its own branch with descriptive commits.

Each [pull request](https://github.com/CodingWithJiro/wesbos-js-30-clock/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) I created contains a clear description, change list, screenshots for UI updates, and reviewer notes.

_This ensures I maintain a professional workflow, even as a solo developer._
